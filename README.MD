# SPARKS 🎆

This is the official repository for **SPARKS**: a **S**equential **P**redictive **A**utoencoder for the **A**nalysis of **S**pi**K**ing **S**ignals. 


SPARKS includes a novel self-attention mechanism using Hebbian learning to generate reliable latent representations from single spike timings. SPARKS trains a variational autoencoder with a novel criterion inspired by predictive coding for temporal coherence.

``sparks`` is implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and includes [demos](https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/SPARKS/sparks/scripts) for a quickstart.
It can perform supervised or unsupervised to produce low-dimensional latent embeddings which allows to gain biological insights from neural data.
